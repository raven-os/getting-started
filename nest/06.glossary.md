* `beta` repository

[//]: # (TODO: add link to the 'repository' and 'packages' entries)
The `beta` [repository]() contains all the beta versions of [packages](), and is being maintained by the Raven-OS team.

## C
[//]: # (TODO: add link to the section 3.2)
* Cache [section 3.2]()

In Nest, the cache is a local copy of the list of available [packages]() from Raven-OS server.
The cache has to be kept up-to-date in order to install the latest versions of the packages.

* Category

[//]: # (TODO: add links to the 'repository' and 'package' entry)
Inside each [repository](), there are several categories.
The [packages]() are split between the repositories and their categories.
Each package name must be unique in a category of a repository, but there can be several packages with the same name spread in several categories.

## D
[//]: # (TODO: add link to the section 1.2)
* Dependency [section 1.2]()

[//]: # (TODO: add link to the 'package' entry)
A dependency is a [package]() A that is required by a package B, so that the package B can function properly.

[//]: # (TODO: add link to the section 4.1.3)
* Dependency graph/Dependency tree [section 4.1.3]()

[//]: # (TODO: add link to the 'package' entry)
The dependency graph is a directed graph (i.e. a graph with directed connections) representing the dependencies between [packages]().
## E

## F
[//]: # (TODO: add link to the chapter 4)
* `finest` [chapter 4]()

[//]: # (TODO: add link to the 'Nest' entry)
`finest` is the binary of [Nest]() targeted towards experienced users.

## G
[//]: # (TODO: add link to the section 4.1.4)

## N
[//]: # (TODO: add link to the chapter 2)
* Nest [chapter 2]()

[//]: # (TODO: add link to the 'package manager' entry)
Nest is a dependency-based [package manager]() for Raven-OS.
It consists of two binaries: `nest` and `finest`.

* `nest`

The binary of Nest mainly targeted towards newcomers.

## O

## P
[//]: # (TODO: add link to the section 1.1)
* Package [section 1.1]()

[//]: # (TODO: add link to the section 1.1)
* Package manager [section 1.1]()

[//]: # (TODO: add link to the 'package' entry)
A package manager allows the user to install, upgrade or remove software [packages]() on their OS, in other words, to manage packages.

## Q

## R
[//]: # (TODO: add link to the section 1.3)
* Repository [section 1.3]()

[//]: # (TODO: add link to the 'package' and 'category' entries)
A repository is a collection of [packages] maintained by the same person or organisation, with all [packages]() usually following the same policy and rules.
In each repository used by Nest, there are several [categories](), which in turn contain several [packages]().

* Requirement

[//]: # (TODO: add link to the 'dependency graph', 'group', 'package' and 'dependency' entries)
Each node of the [dependency graph]() having a requirement can fulfill it by another node or another [group]().
A requirement is a [dependency]() that can be fulfilled by one and only one [package](), and is noted as `repository::category/package#[version|version_requirement]`.

## S
* `stable` repository

[//]: # (TODO: add link to the 'repository' and 'package' entries)
The `stable` [repository]() contains all the stable [packages]() that are safe to use, and is maintained by the Raven-OS team.

## T
[//]: # (TODO: add link to the section 4.1.2)
* Transactions [section 4.1.2]()

[//]: # (TODO:: add link to the 'package' entry)
A transaction is an action of Nest on the filesystem.
