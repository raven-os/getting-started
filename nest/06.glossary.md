* Cache

In Nest, the cache is a local copy of the list of available packages from Raven-OS server.
The cache has to be kept up-to-date in order to install the latest versions of the packages.

* Category

Inside each repository, there are several categories.
The packages are split between the repositories and their categories.
Each package name must be unique in a category of a repository, but there can be several packages with the same name spread in several categories.

## D
* Dependency

There is a dependency when a package depends on another one to function properly.

* Dependency graph/Dependency tree

The dependency graph is a directed graph representing the dependencies of packages.

## E

## F

* `finest group remove <name> [--parent <group>]`

The command of `finest` to remove a group, with `@root` as a parent by default.

* `finest merge`

The command of `finest` to merge the dependency graph `finest` altered with the transactions you applied, with the dependency graph currently in use by the OS.

* `finest requirement add <requirement> [--parent <group>]`
