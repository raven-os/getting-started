# 1 Introduction
## 1.1 What is a package manager?
A package is a compressed file archive containing all the files required to install, uninstall and update a particular software or application.

A package manager allows the user to install, upgrade or remove software packages on their OS, in other words, to **manage packages**.
It is similar to an app store for a smartphone, or the Windows Store for example.
With Nest, it's up to the user to upgrade their installed packages whenever they want.

Currently, to use Nest, one must use its Command Line Interface (CLI).
This might sound intimidating for someone who has never seen a terminal or typed any command before, but if that's the case, don't worry! This guide is here to help you feel at home.

## 1.2 Packages and dependencies
It is common for a package to require other ones to work properly.
Say, for example, someone develops a messenging application, which relies on encrypted messages to provide communication between two users.
This application will probably use a package, written by someone else, to encrypt the messages sent with their app.
We say that such messenging application **depends** on that encryption package, because without that package, the application would probably not work at all.
Now, if you want that application to work properly, you'll also need to install the package they used to encrypt messages.

If a package is required by another one to work properly, that package is called a **dependency**.
Whenever you install a package via a package manager (and Nest as well), it will check if the package in question has any dependencies.
And if it does, it will install only the dependencies that are not already installed.
So, when you install a package, don't be surprised if you see other packages getting installed too, they are just dependencies needed for that package to work properly.

## 1.3 Repositories
Packages are stored in repositories.
Within each repository, there are a certain number of categories, and a package has to belong to one, and only one of them.
The categories are a way to distinguish packages with the same name, but having different purposes.
This means that we can have two packages with the same name, in the same repository but not in the same category, coexisting together, without any issue.

For now, all you need to know is that there are official and unofficial repositories for Nest.
Only `stable`, which is an official repository, is enabled by default.
This repository contains all the packages that are considered stable and safe to use.
The repositories will be more detailed in [the section 3.1]().

## 1.4 Package name syntax
In Nest, the package names are structured in the following way: `repository::category/package#version`.
If no version is specified, the latest one available is taken by default.

However, most parts of this syntax may be omitted if it matches **one** and only **one** package.
In a way, the only real mandatory part of this syntax is the package name itself. That means you can use:
* `repository::package`, if that package is the only one with its name in the whole repository.
* `category/package`, if the package's name is unique in this specific category, and if that category belongs to a single repository used by Nest.
* `package`, if that package is the only one with its name amongst all the repositories used by Nest.

If you're not sure on the repository, category, or name of a package, you can check on [Raven-OS official website](https://stable.raven-os.org).
It lists all the packages in the repository `stable` of Nest, as well as the category they belong to, the latest version released, and a short description of what they provide.
The repository `stable` is one of the official repositories available for Nest, and is enabled by default.

And that's it for the introduction!
Those were some fundamental concepts, and we strongly recommend you to make sure you understand them before moving on to the [next chapter](), where we'll start detailing how to use `nest`.
