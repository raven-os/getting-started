# 3 The templates
Templates are functions that provide a default, configurable and extendable way to build packages of a certain type.
There are different kinds of templates:
* **Partial templates** are templates that provide only a chunk of the overall build process, like a template that wraps a specific build system but doesn't download any source code or generate any package.
They are usually used as a sub-part of an **exhaustive template**.
* **Exhaustive templates** are templates that provide all the steps involved in the building process, like downloading the source code, building it, generating the packages, managing dependencies, etc.

[`autotools`](https://docs.raven-os.org/nbuild/master/stdlib.template.autotools.html#module-stdlib.template.autotools) is an **exhaustive template** that downloads, builds and wraps a software based on `autoconf` and `make`.
We will discuss this template in the next chapter.
