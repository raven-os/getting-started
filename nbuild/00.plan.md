# nbuild getting started

## Introduction

## 1 `nbuild`
## 1.1 How `nbuild` works
- what `nbuild` is for
- how to use `nbuild`

## 2 The build manifest
## 2.1 Writing a build manifest
- two kinds of packages: effective & virtual
virtual = a generic name that applies to any one of a group of packages, all providing similar basic functionalities. For example, both `firefox` and `waterfox` are web browsers and satisfy dpendencies of programs requiring a web browser.
effective might be just the opposite
- explain the different field in a manifest:
    * has to be a tarball
    * one entry per version, semver
## 2.2 `npf-checker`
## 2.3 Downloading, building and wraping a software
- pour différents split: par défaut, split nul, mais sinon faut faire une fonction `split` pour bouger les trucs où il faut
- depedencies
- write your own function if you don't want a generic behaviour for autotools.build()
## 2.4 Upload a manifest to an official or unofficial Raven-OS server
You have to PR `build-manifests` and `build-raven-os-org` will autopush the packages on `unstable` once the PR is validated. The Raven-OS team will move them manually once they're considered safe and stable enough, to `beta` and then to `stable`.
You can build a manifest on your own computer, then upload it on your server while hosting your instance of `nest-server`.
