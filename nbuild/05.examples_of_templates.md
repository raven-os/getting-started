## 3.2 Examples of build manifests overwriting the templates
### 3.2.1 Overwriting `autotools`
The manifest of readline is a good example showing how the steps `configure`, `compile` and `install` from the `autotools` template can be overwriten:
```python
...
packages = autotools.build(
        configure=lambda: configure(
            '--with-ncurses',
            '--enable-multibyte',
        ),
        compile=lambda: make('SHLIB_LIBS=-lncursesw'),  # Ensures readline is linked against the libncursesw library
        install=lambda: make('install', 'SHLIB_LIBS=-lncursesw', f'DESTDIR={build.install_cache}'),
    )
...
```
All these steps have basically been overwritten to add arguments to them.

In the case of the `configure` step, the flags `--with-ncurses` and `--enable-multibyte` have been added to the original [`configure()`](https://docs.raven-os.org/p/nbuild/master/stdlib.template.configure.html#stdlib.template.configure.configure) function.

For the `compile` step, the [`make()`](https://docs.raven-os.org/p/nbuild/master/stdlib.template.make.html#stdlib.template.make.make) function has been overwritten by adding the option `SHLIB_LIBS=-lncursesw` to it.
This makes sure that readline is linked against the `libncurses` library.

As for the `install` step, the same option as above has been added to its [`make()`](https://docs.raven-os.org/p/nbuild/master/stdlib.template.make.html#stdlib.template.make.make) function as well as the `DESTDIR` variable.

### 3.2.2 Other templates
At the time of writing, there's only one template: `autotools`. In the future, we plan to add more.
