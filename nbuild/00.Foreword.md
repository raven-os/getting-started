# Foreword
Welcome to Nest build's official getting-started guide!

Nest build, or `nbuild`, is an automated package builder for [Raven-OS](https://raven-os.org), which is an adaptative, customizable and evolutive open-source Operating System (OS) based on the Linux kernel.
`nbuild` can be run on any linux-based distribution.

## Documentation
`nbuild`'s documentation is hosted [there](https://docs.raven-os.org/nbuild/master), but it can also be locally generated with the following commands:
```
$ pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
$ sphinx-apidoc -f --separate -o docs/source/ .
$ make -C docs html
```
The main page can be accessed at `docs/build/html/index.html`.
