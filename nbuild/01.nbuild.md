## 1.1 What `nbuild` is for
[//]: # (TODO: Add link to the getting-started for Nest)
`nbuild` is an automated package builder.
From a build manifest and source code, `nbuild` will abstract the build system used (cmake, autoconf, etc.), compile the software, get the executable files and files to install (binaries, libraries, manual pages, etc.) and wrap them in a package that Nest will know how to install: a `.nest` archive, called an npf file.
It contains a `data.tar.gz` with all the files to install, if there are any, and a build manifest `manifest.toml`, containing basic information and metadata for this software (its name, version, description, licenses, etc.).

All of this is done thanks to a powerful library included in `nbuild`: the standard compilation library, for which you can find the documentation right [there](https://docs.raven-os.org/nbuild/master/stdlib.html).

`nbuild` requires python3.6+, and you will first need to install `nbuild`'s dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## 1.2 How to use `nbuild`
There are several flags for `nbuild`:
* `--config CONFIG` allows you to change the static configuration file for `nbuild`.
By default, it's `config.toml`.
* `-o OUTPUT_DIR` or `--output-dir OUTPUT_DIR` changes the output directory for the built packages.
By default, it's `packages/`.
* `-c CACHE_DIR` or `--cache-dir CACHE_DIR` changes the cache directory used when downloading and building packages.
By default, it's `cache/`
* `--purge` removes all cached data.
